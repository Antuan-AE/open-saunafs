/*! \brief Base ReadPlan class.
 *
 * This class stores data required to handle complex read operation.
 *
 * Let's analyze typical read operation for ec(3,2) (erasure code with 3 data parts
 * and 2 parity parts). We have all chunk parts available.
 *
 * One possible read plan for this situation could look like this:
 *
 * wave 0: read part 1, read part 2, read part 3
 * wave 1: read part 4, read part 5
 *
 * In the first wave we start operation for all data parts. Unfortunately, chunkserver with
 * part 1 cannot send requested part. We reach wave timeout with only two parts.
 * At this moment we start executing reads from next wave. After some time we receive
 * part 5. The isReadingFinished function returns true because we are able to recover
 * data part 3 from available data and parity parts. The postProcessData function computes
 * missing data and operation is finished.
 *
 * With the ReadPlan, much more complicated scenarios with
 * recovery and multiple conversions in the same read operations are possible.
