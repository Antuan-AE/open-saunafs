# sfshdd.cfg(5)
#
# Chunks are divided into metadata (.met) and data (.dat) parts.
# Each line of this file must match the following syntax:
# [*]metadata_dir[ | data_dir]
#
# Sample file for two HDD drives with metadata and data in the same location:
#/mnt/hdd1
#/mnt/hdd2
#
# The following drive is marked for removal with '*':
#*/mnt/hdd3
#
# The next line can be used to store the metadata chunk parts in a different
# drive than the data parts:
#/mnt/nvme1 | /mnt/hhd1
